# How many times have you wondered 'how long is this thing runnuning?'.
# This .bashrc entry helps you answer this question as every command
# will now have an attached timestamp.

# You could add date to get full timestamp but that would make prompt
# rather longish. Anyway, if you keep your username and machine name
# short, than you might afford full timestamp in prompt as well.
